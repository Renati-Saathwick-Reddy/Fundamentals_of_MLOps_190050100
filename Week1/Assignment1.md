1. ### AIOps :
  **AIOps** is short for artificial intelligence for IT operations. It refers to multi-layered technology platforms that automate and enhance IT operations through analytics and machine learning (ML). AIOps platforms leverage big data, collecting a variety of data from various IT operations tools and devices in order to automatically spot and react to issues in real-time while still providing traditional historical analytics.
  Contrast between MLOps and AIOps
  | MLOps | AIOps |
  | ----------- | ----------- |
  | Standardizes ML system development process | Automates IT operations and systems |    
  | Increases efficiency and productivity of the team	| Automates root cause analysis and resolution |    
  | Streamline collaboration between different teams | Process and manage a large amount of data effectively and efficiently |    
  | It is a crucial part of deploying AI and Data Science at scale and in a repeatable manner | It leverages revolutionary AI technologies to solve IT challenges |
