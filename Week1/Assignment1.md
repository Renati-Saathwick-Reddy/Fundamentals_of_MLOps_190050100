1. ### AIOps :
  **AIOps** is short for artificial intelligence for IT operations. It refers to multi-layered technology platforms that automate and enhance IT operations through analytics and machine learning (ML). AIOps platforms leverage big data, collecting a variety of data from various IT operations tools and devices in order to automatically spot and react to issues in real-time while still providing traditional historical analytics.
  Contrast between MLOps and AIOps

2. ### Interpretable Machine Learning
A Machine Learning model is said to be Interpretable Machine Learning Model if a human understands the decisions the model is making.

 The biggest advantage of linear regression models is linearity: It makes the estimation procedure simple and, most importantly, these linear equations have an easy to understand interpretation on a modular level (i.e. the weights) which makes it interpretable.
 The linear regression model forces the prediction to be a linear combination of features, which is both its greatest strength and its greatest limitation. Linearity leads to interpretable models. Linear effects are easy to quantify and describe. They are additive, so it is easy to separate the effects. If you suspect feature interactions or a nonlinear association of a feature with the target value, you can add interaction terms or use regression splines.

3. ### AutoML
**Automated Machine Learning** provides methods and processes to make Machine Learning available for non-Machine Learning experts, to improve efficiency of Machine Learning and to accelerate research on Machine Learning.
 Automated ML is designed to help professional data scientists be more productive and spend their precious time concentrating on specialized tasks such as tuning and optimizing the models, alongside mapping real-world cases to ML problems, rather than spending time in monotonous tasks like trial and error with a bunch of algorithms. Automated ML with its newly introduced UI mode (akin to a wizard) also helps open the doors of machine learning to novice or non-professional data scientists as they can now become valuable contributors in data science teams by leveraging these augmented capabilities and churning out accurate models to accelerate time to market. This ability to expand data science teams beyond the handful of highly specialized data scientists enables enterprises to invest and reap the benefits of machine learning at scale without having to compromise high-value use cases due to the lack of data science talent.

**AutoML Tools**
1.Auto-Keras
Auto-Keras is an open-source software library for automated machine learning (AutoML). It is developed by DATA Lab at Texas A&M University and community contributors. Auto-Keras provides functions to automatically search for architecture and hyperparameters of deep learning models.

2.H20AutoML
H2O is an open source, distributed in-memory machine learning platform with linear scalability. H2O includes an automatic machine learning module also called H2OAutoML which can be used for automating the machine learning workflow,  which includes automatic training and tuning of many models within a user-specified time-limit.
Whereas, H2O.ai’s flagship product Driverless AI is for automatic machine learning. It fully automates some of the most challenging and productive tasks in applied data science such as feature engineering, model tuning, model ensembling and model deployment.

3.SMAC
SMAC (sequential model-based algorithm configuration) is a versatile tool for optimizing algorithm parameters. SMAC is very effective for hyperparameter optimization of machine learning algorithms, scaling better to high dimensions and discrete input dimensions than other algorithms.

4.AUTO-SKLEARN
Auto-sklearn provides out-of-the-box supervised machine learning. Built around the scikit-learn machine learning library, auto-sklearn automatically searches for the right learning algorithm for a new machine learning dataset and optimizes its hyperparameters. 

5.Amazon Lex
Amazon Lex provides the advanced deep learning functionalities of automatic speech recognition (ASR) for converting speech to text, and natural language understanding (NLU) and enables the user to build applications with highly engaging user experiences and lifelike conversational interactions. 
Amazon Lex makes Amazon Alexa available to all the developers allowing them to quickly and easily build sophisticated, natural language, conversational bots.

6.AUTOWEKA
Auto-WEKA considers the problem of simultaneously selecting a learning algorithm and setting its hyperparameters. Auto-WEKA does this using a fully automated approach, leveraging recent innovations in Bayesian optimization and help non-expert users to more effectively identify machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter settings appropriate to their applications.

7.AUTO-PYTORCH
Auto-PyTorch automates  right architecture and hyperparameter settings by using multi-fidelity optimization and Bayesian optimization (BOHB) to search for the best settings.

8.ROBO
RoBO – a Robust Bayesian Optimization framework written in python. The core of RoBO is a modular framework that allows to easily add and exchange components of Bayesian optimization such as different acquisition functions or regression models. 
It contains a variety of different regression models such as Gaussian processes, Random Forests or Bayesian neural networks and different acquisition function such as expected improvement, probability of improvement, lower confidence bound or information gain.

9.AUTOFOLIO
AutoFolio uses algorithm configuration to optimize the performance of algorithm selection systems by determining the best selection approach and its hyperparameters.
Algorithm selection (AS) techniques — which involve choosing from a set of algorithms the one expected to solve a given problem instance most efficiently — have substantially improved the state-of-the-art in solving many prominent AI problems.

10.FLEXFOLIO
Flexfolio, a modular and open solver architecture that integrates several different portfolio-based algorithm selection approaches and techniques. It provides a unique framework for comparing and combining existing portfolio-based algorithm selection approaches and techniques in a single, unified framework.
