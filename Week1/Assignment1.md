1. ### AIOps :
  **AIOps** is short for artificial intelligence for IT operations. It refers to multi-layered technology platforms that automate and enhance IT operations through analytics and machine learning (ML). AIOps platforms leverage big data, collecting a variety of data from various IT operations tools and devices in order to automatically spot and react to issues in real-time while still providing traditional historical analytics.
  Contrast between MLOps and AIOps
  | MLOps | AIOps |
  | ----------- | ----------- |
  | Standardizes ML system development process | Automates IT operations and systems |    
  | Increases efficiency and productivity of the team	| Automates root cause analysis and resolution |    
  | Streamline collaboration between different teams | Process and manage a large amount of data effectively and efficiently |    
  | It is a crucial part of deploying AI and Data Science at scale and in a repeatable manner | It leverages revolutionary AI technologies to solve IT challenges |

2. ### Interpretable Machine Learning
A Machine Learning model is said to be Interpretable Machine Learning Model if a human understands the decisions the model is making.

 The biggest advantage of linear regression models is linearity: It makes the estimation procedure simple and, most importantly, these linear equations have an easy to understand interpretation on a modular level (i.e. the weights) which makes it interpretable.
 The linear regression model forces the prediction to be a linear combination of features, which is both its greatest strength and its greatest limitation. Linearity leads to interpretable models. Linear effects are easy to quantify and describe. They are additive, so it is easy to separate the effects. If you suspect feature interactions or a nonlinear association of a feature with the target value, you can add interaction terms or use regression splines.
